# 3D Rubik's Cube Simulation

This is a 3D Rubik's Cube simulation built using Processing in Java. The cube can be rotated using keyboard inputs, and future updates will include click-to-turn functionality, a scramble button, and a timer to track solving time.

## Features
- **3D Rendering**: The cube is rendered in 3D using Processing's `P3D` mode.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Rotate the cube faces using keyboard keys (`u`, `d`, `l`, `r`, `f`, `b`).
- **Scramble Function**: Randomly scramble the cube with the `z` key.
- **Customizable Cube Size**: Supports NxNxN cubes (currently set to 3x3x3).

## Future Improvements
1. **Click-to-Turn**: Allow users to click on a face to rotate it.
2. **Scramble Button**: Add a UI button to scramble the cube.
3. **Timer**: Implement a timer to track how long it takes to solve the cube.
4. **Improved Rotation Logic**: Use transformation matrices for more efficient rotations.
5. **Color Customization**: Allow users to customize the cube's colors.

## Getting Started
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Processing installed.
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlexGundrum/Rubiks-Cube-Simulation.git
   ```
3. Open in processing: Open project in processing IDE
4. Click "Run"

## Controls
b: Rotate the blue face.
g: Rotate the green face.
o: Rotate the orange face.
r: Rotate the red face.
w: Rotate the white face.
y: Rotate the yellow face.
z: Scramble the cube.
